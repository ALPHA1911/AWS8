Lenscape is a minimal, thoughtfully designed single page website template, and serves as the perfect showcase for a professional photographer.

Here you can find the original [PSD](https://symu.co/freebies/templates-4/Lenscape-psd-template/)
by Jakub Kowalczyk.

This project was developed with Jade, Sass, and jQuery.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
